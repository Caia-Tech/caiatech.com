## Internal Linking Strategy

### Hub-to-Hub Linking Pattern
```
Integration Hub ←→ Security Hub ←→ Ethics Hub
     ↑                 ↑              ↑
Infrastructure Hub ←→ Patterns Hub ←→ Performance Hub
     ↓                 ↓              ↓  
Moderation Hub ←→ Optimization Hub ←→ Tools Hub
```

### Article-to-Article Linking Rules

1. **Foundation Articles**: Link to 5+ related implementation articles
2. **Implementation Articles**: Link to 3+ foundation articles, 2+ advanced topics
3. **Pillar Pages**: Link to ALL supporting articles in hub
4. **Cross-Hub Links**: Each hub links to 2-3 related hubs
5. **External Links**: 8-10 authoritative external sources per pillar page

### Contextual Linking Examples
```html
<!-- In "AI as Web Consumers" article -->
<p>Once you understand how AI systems parse content, you'll want to 
implement <a href="/ai-authentication/handshake-protocol">proper AI authentication protocols</a> 
to ensure secure interactions.</p>

<!-- In "AI Authentication" article -->
<p>Before implementing authentication, make sure your content is 
<a href="/ai-web-integration/semantic-html">properly structured for AI comprehension</a>.</p>
```
