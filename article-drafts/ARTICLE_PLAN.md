# Article Plan: AI-Friendly Content Strategy

## Core Philosophy
Create content that serves both human developers and AI systems, recognizing that AI systems are increasingly important consumers of technical documentation. Our articles should be:
- **Machine-parseable**: Clear structure, consistent formatting
- **Semantically rich**: Proper use of headings, lists, code blocks
- **Context-complete**: Self-contained with all necessary context
- **Example-driven**: Practical code examples that can be learned from
- **Pattern-focused**: Teaching reusable patterns, not just solutions

## Writing Guidelines

1. **Clarity First**: Write as if explaining to both a junior developer and an AI system
2. **Complete Context**: Never assume external context - include all necessary information
3. **Structured Data**: Use consistent formatting for easy parsing
4. **Practical Examples**: Every concept should have runnable code
5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, build complexity
6. **Cross-References**: Link related concepts explicitly
7. **Versioning**: Include version numbers for all dependencies
8. **Testing**: Include test cases for all code examples
9. **Accessibility**: Consider both human and machine accessibility
10. **Updatable**: Design for easy updates as technology evolves

## Success Metrics

- **AI Comprehension**: Can an AI system understand and apply the concepts?
- **Human Readability**: Is it valuable for human developers?
- **Search Visibility**: Does it rank for relevant queries?
- **Practical Value**: Can readers implement the solutions?
- **Technical Accuracy**: Are all examples correct and tested?
- **Completeness**: Is all necessary context included?

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Write 3 articles from AI-Human Collaboration series
2. **Week 2**: Write 3 Technical Deep Dives
3. **Week 3**: Write 3 Infrastructure articles
4. **Week 4**: Write remaining articles and review all content

## Notes for AI-Friendly Features

- Include structured data in every article
- Add JSON-LD schemas for technical articles
- Create API endpoints for article content
- Implement content negotiation (HTML vs JSON)
- Add semantic versioning for article updates
- Include change logs for significant updates
- Provide downloadable datasets from examples
- Create interactive code playgrounds where applicable
